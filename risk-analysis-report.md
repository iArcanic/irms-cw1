# 1 Introduction

A high-tech company with approximately 400 employees in its workforce, has recently been awarded a major UK government contract, with the additional bonus of 30% revenue to the organisation. This project is now therefore considered with the utmost importance and therefore requires significant focus and dedicated resources.

Since the company does not already work with any UK Governments beforehand, its existing information security policies and regulations are highly unlikely to meet the UK's governmental standards. This means that it is mandatory to implement robust compliance measures and information security protocols to adhere to UK government vendors.

This risk analysis report aims to analyse the company's current security mindset, identify any vulnerabilities within their present setup technologies and infrastructure used, and outline any outstanding actions to address any security gaps via a credible security framework. Based on this, recommendations will also be provided to execute the appropriate actions that help safeguard against security threats and sustainably comply with the necessary protocols or laws defined by the UK government. With this, it is advantageous for the company to capitalise on this opportunity for general business growth and profit maximisation.
