# 1 Introduction

A high-tech company with approximately 400 employees in its workforce, has recently been awarded a major UK government contract, with the additional bonus of 30% revenue to the organisation. This project is now therefore considered with the utmost importance and therefore requires significant focus and dedicated resources.

Since the company does not already work with any UK Governments beforehand, its existing information security policies and regulations are highly unlikely to meet the UK's governmental standards. This means that it is mandatory to implement robust compliance measures and information security protocols to adhere to UK government vendors.

This risk analysis report aims to analyse the company's current security mindset, identify any vulnerabilities within their present setup technologies and infrastructure used, and outline any outstanding actions to address any security gaps via a credible security framework. Based on this, recommendations will also be provided to execute the appropriate actions that help safeguard against security threats and sustainably comply with the necessary protocols or laws defined by the UK government. With this, it is advantageous for the company to capitalise on this opportunity for general business growth and profit maximisation.

# 2 Evaluation of organisational risk posture

## 2.1 Standards, controls, and policies

Given that the company looks to diversify into UK governmental territory, is it crucial that the information security policies are in alignment with governmental regulations and industrial standards.

### 2.1.1 Governmental policies – Security Policy Framework (SPF)

This is a framework that provides 14 guidelines across various categories, such as physical, personnel, and cybersecurity that third party-suppliers and any public entities must comply with when handling information assets relating to the public.

### 2.1.2 ISO/IEC standards – 27001:2013

An internationally recognised standard for security published by ISO and IEC as a set of requirements for information security management via a set of technical security mechanisms. A valid certification proves a secure information security management system in line with the CIA triad attributes.

### 2.1.3 Cloud security guidance – CSA Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)

Guidance for cloud-based services and technologies adapted for security controls and general cyber resilience. Refers to best industry practices by adopting well-known frameworks such as to help evaluate risks and assess security obligations within a cloud context.

### 2.1.4 End user device guidelines – EUD Security Guidance

Recommended risk treatment when considering deployment on the end user or personal devices to mitigate any remote-based vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.
